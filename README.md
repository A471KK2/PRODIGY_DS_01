# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship - Task 01

## Task Description

Task 01 of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship involves creating visualizations to represent categorical or continuous distribution. The visualizations are developed using Power BI, focusing on creating bar charts to effectively illustrate the data.

## Visualizations

In this task, I have created bar charts to analyze and present the distribution of continuous data. These visualizations help in understanding the demographic patterns and trends within the dataset. As it was mentioned that we can use any dataset, I have used the USA Population dataset from Neilsberg - Global Research and Advisory Firm for this Task 01 to visualize more effectively.

## Tools Used

- *Power BI*: For creating interactive and insightful visualizations.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this task is the "united-states-us-census-bureau-intercensal-estimates-of-the-resident-population" dataset, which can be downloaded from [this dataset link](https://www.neilsberg.com/research/datasets/5fd2b2bb-3d85-11ee-9abe-0aa64bf2eeb2/).
## Visualizations Overview

1. *Bar Charts*: 
   - Various bar charts show different aspects of the categorical or continuous distribution.
     
## How to View the Visualizations

1. Download the dataset from the provided Given link.
2. Open the Power BI file (with a .pbix extension) included in this repository.
3. Explore the different sheets to view the bar charts created.

## Repository Structure

- USA Population dataset: This dataset contains the dataset used for the visualizations.
- PRODIGY_DS_01: Contains a Power BI file with the created visualizations.
- README.md: This file provides an overview of the task and how to use the repository.

## Getting Started

To get started with viewing the visualizations:

1. Ensure you have Power BI installed on your machine.
2. Download the dataset from [Neilsberg](https://www.neilsberg.com/research/datasets/5fd2b2bb-3d85-11ee-9abe-0aa64bf2eeb2/).
3. Open the Power BI file from the visualizations directory.
4. Explore the different visualizations to understand the categorical or continuous distribution.

## Conclusion

This task was a great opportunity to apply data visualization techniques using Power BI. The bar graph created provides a clear and concise view of the categorical, or continuous, distribution within the dataset.
